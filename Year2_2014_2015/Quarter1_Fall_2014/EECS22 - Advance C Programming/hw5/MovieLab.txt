Assignment 5: MovieLab
12/10/2014

I found this assignment to be particularly challenging.

The assignment felt a bit overwhelming, being our first time coding a Double-Linked List,
command line inputs, and function pointers.

Even with a lot of the descriptions in the assignment, it took a considerable amount of
time to read through the given code, properly understand what it meant, and then add the
necessary code to make the MovieLab work.

The example code in the lecture slides was essential to being able to get started with
the assignment. The TA slides helped with understanding the command line input code and
how to code the -rvs function, but the Makefile diagram was misleading.

Making a new list, appending images, and deleting the list was easy enough to code.
However, the -fast,-cut,-rvs functions took a considerable amount of time to understand and code
because of how difficult it was for me to think of how all the pointers changed in the
Double-Linked list.

How to make the Movie.c functions was easy implement as the description was pretty clear.

For the MovieLab.c, I felt that it wasnt clear stated what operations were supposed
to be done after the command line inputs were receieved by the user. like create the movie,
read it, save it, delete it. I don't know. maybe I didnt see it.

Overall, I felt that it was more challenging coding this assignment than the previous ones.
I managed to complete the assignment, but I did not enjoy doing it. Atleast I finally 
understand the concepts.

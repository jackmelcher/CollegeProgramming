Homework 1 Text File: Making the Blackjack game

I Started by Initializing the variables for the game.
These include the integers for player's hand, the dealer's hand, and the car being drawn.
Included two addition integers that would end the player's turn and end the dealer's turn.

Added a char called playerSelection that will be used to varify whether the user wanted to draw another card or not.

Initialized the random number generator using time.h and stdlib.h libraries.

When a card was drawn by the player or dealer, it would be the numbers 1 to 13.
Setup several if statements so that numbers 11, 12, and 13 were the Jack, Queen, and King.

The screen will print the values of the cards drawn, and the value of the player's hand and dealer's hand.

Setup a while loop for when it was the players turn.
The loop would end once the playerTurn integer was greater than one.

I used a switch statement with three cases for the player.
If player selects 1, they draw another card.
If player selects 0, their turn is over.
The default case is used for any other user inputs.

The player can continue to select cards as long as he is less than 21, or choose to end their turn.
If player has a hand equal to 21, Their turn ends and the dealer's turn begins.
When the player's hand is greater than 21, the game automatically ends.

When the player's turn is over, the dealer's turn starts.
The dealer is setup in a while loop to automatically draw until it either wins or loses.
Dealer wins if his hand is greater than or equal to that of the player.
Player wins if his hand is greater than dealer's.

After the dealer's turn is over, it displays who won the game and the game is over.

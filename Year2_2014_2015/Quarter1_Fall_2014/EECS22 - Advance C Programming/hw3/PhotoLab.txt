EECS 22 Assignment 3: PhotoLab v2

Constructing PhotoLab v2 was more challenging than expected.

Dealing with multiple source files can be confusing at first. Eventually I realized how each file worked.
I created new header files and placed the declarations of functions into their respective .h files
The global constants went into the Constants.h file
And then the functions and what they did went into their respective.c files.

Compiling the file using a Makefile saved a lot of time and is a very useful tool.
I provided the necessary targets and dependecies so each file will compile properly.

Adding in the new functions in the Advanced.c file was a bit challenging.

Posterizing required manipulation of the bits using bitwise operations &,|,<<,>> It took some time to understand how to get it to work.
The specifics are in the comments of my code and shown by the code itself.

Fill Lights function was pretty straightforward. just add a bunch of lights within the boundary of the image.
Again, its explained in the comments of my code.

Overlay was a bit tricky. It required me to temporarily store the RingMall image, load up Peter or Spider, store that image,
make the image pure white, replace the new image with offset, and then restore the old image with the overlay.
Then i found out that the overlay images were not 100% white and had to adjust my check accordingly.

All in all, I believe all three functions work.

Implementing the DEBUG macro was tricky for me. there wasnt a whole lot of reference to go off of.
So I created new variables within the DEBUG macro for both PhotoLab.c and FileIO.c
With these variables, I used them to check whether or not certain statements would print.

And again, the method I used works and I was able to create the appropriate executables.

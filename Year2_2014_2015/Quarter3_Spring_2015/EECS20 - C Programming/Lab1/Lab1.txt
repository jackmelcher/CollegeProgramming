LC-3 Psuedo Code

.ORIG
	Where the code is put in memory, the starting location of the program
	PC is set to the .ORIG value prior to execution
	Example: .ORIG x4000 means the code begins at memory address x4000

TRAP x22 (PUT)
	Prints a string onto the console window
	Address of the first character in string is in R0

.STRINGZ
	Declares a string of characters
	Example: string_name .STRINGZ "Content of string"

TRAP x25 (HALT)
	Ends the program with the use of a forever loop.

.END
	Where the assembly stops
